"""
    This program is to check if the given text is Palindrome or NOT.
    We reverse the text and compare with original text for equality.
    The text is a Palindrome is they are equal, else the text is NOT a palindrome.

    Pseudocode:
        1. Prompt the user for text
        2. Read the text from user
        3. Reverse the user given text
        4. Compare original text with reversed text for equality
        5. IF check is true then it is a palindrome
           ELSE it is not a palindrome
"""

# Prompt and read text from user
text_data = input("Enter a value: ")
# Reverse the given text using slicing and compare with original text
if text_data[::-1] == text_data:
    print(n, "is a Palindrome")
else:
    print(n, "is NOT a Palindrome")
